These are zipped-up libraries for distribution, since there's no easy way to properly build and bundle up dependencies with the way PyKrita works

[`py_snappy`](https://github.com/ethereum/py-snappy) is included for decompression only. This module is bound by it's own [LICENSE](https://github.com/ethereum/py-snappy/blob/master/LICENSE).

`py_fastlz` is a custom module that was designed for this project. It comes with no guarantees. This module will be published as standalone package soon.
